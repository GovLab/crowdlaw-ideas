    <h2>WHAT IS<br>BIG HEALTH DATA?</h2>
    <p>Big health data refers to the ability to gather and analyze large quantities of information about health,
      wellness and lifestyle. Big health data includes information from health care providers as well as data from
      sources such
      as apps that track our sleep and exercise habits and the purchases we make.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-box">
    <p>Doctors, healthcare organizations,
      insurance companies, financial service providers, product and service companies and governments at every level are
      keen to use such data.</p>
    <h2>The Good News?</h2>
    <p>More use and sharing of data could enable better diagnoses,
      more targeted prevention and treatments, faster research and cures, creation
      of new tools to help us make healthier choices and economic growth from
      the creation of health data businesses.</p>
    <h2>The Bad News?</h2>
    <p>The collection, sharing and use of big health data could reveal sensitive personal information over which we have
      little control. This data can be sold without our consent. It can be used by entities for surveillance or
      discrimination, rather than to promote well-being. </p>

    <h2>YOUR VOICE MATTERS. AARP WANTS TO HEAR FROM YOU!</h2>
    <p>The ideas below are opportunities and challenges arising from
      the greater use of data in healthcare. Share your opinions about these issues and help
      inform AARP in developing its policies on “big health data.” </p>
    <br>
    <p>You will be presented with a series of two-option questions. Tell us which, between the two options, is your
      greater concern. These options might be dangers from the use of data or from the failure to use data.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Answer as many two-option questions as you like…or add your own option! The more you tell us, the better we can
      understand
      the possible challenges of big health data together.</p>
