        <h2>Overview</h2>
       <p> All Our Ideas was designed by Professor Matthew Salganik of Princeton University. 
        
        This version of All Our Ideas is hosted by The Governance Lab at New York University.
        
        All Our Ideas is powered by open source software. Feel free to review, remix, or redesign. Also, you can use the All Our Ideas API to create your own pairwise comparison site.</p>
        
        <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
        <p>You may vote on questions anonymously. 
        
        However, when creating a new survey, you will be required to enter your email address.
        
        All visitors to the site will have their IP address geolocated using a publicly available database. We store your approximate location, as inferred from your IP address, and a cryptographic hash of your 
        IP address in our database. We do not store IP addresses in our database. We may also use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to track traffic on the website.
        
        Further, like most websites, we use cookies to enhance your experience, gather general visitor information, and track visits to our website. Please refer to the "do we use cookies?" section below for 
        information about cookies and how we use them.</p>
        
        <h2>How do we use your information?</h2>
        <p>We do not collect or use information about how an individual voted. Rather, we collect and use aggregate data for research purposes. We are interested in broad patterns not in how any one particular 
          person voted. So, for example, we are interested in the average number of votes cast in each session, but we are not interested in identifying who said they liked chocolate ice cream better than vanilla ice cream.</p>
        
        <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
        
        <h2>Do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize 
          your browser and capture and remember certain information.
        
        In order to offer you a better site experience, we use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and to compile aggregate data about site traffic.</p>
        
        <h2>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h2>
        <p>Aggregated results (e.g. results of a given survey) are publicly visible to you and the world. 
        
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting research, or 
        servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or 
        protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>
        
        <h2>Third party links</h2>
        <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include links to third party websites. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We, therefore, have no responsibility or liability for the content
           and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
        
        <h2>Web servers</h2>
        <p>Our web servers are provided by Digital Ocean.</p>
        
        <h2>Your consent</h2>
        <p>By using our site, you consent to our privacy policy.
        
        In compliance with our obligations to the Princeton University Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects, we reserve the right to remove, at any time, any content that we deem objectionable in any way, or which 
        creates any physical, legal, social, or psychological risk to individuals.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to our Privacy and Consent Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to change our privacy policy from time to time at our sole discretion. Please periodically check this section to review the current version of the Privacy and Consent Policy. All our previous
           policies are presented below, and we will continue to update this page if any changes are needed.</p>
